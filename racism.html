                Being racist is a personal choice, just as being vegan is a personal choice, so everyone should live and let live.

                I love people enough to fulfill their needs while they're alive, but I also understand that sometimes they need to be killed to satisfy my needs. So there is no conflict between loving people and killing them.

                It's important for civilians to be treated well, so I only kill soldiers who went to war in a way that is free from suffering, and death is quick and humanitarian.

                Raising children in multiculturalism is brainwashing because children are too young to make significant decisions on this topic. Children have the right to be racists, so forcing multiculturalism and tolerance on them is unethical.

            Do you feel outraged when reading these arguments about racism? Do you consider them unethical and absurd, and you think that such type of reasoning should not be tolerated and applied to living beings, especially innocent ones? If so, click this button: <button class="human_liberation">Human Liberation</button>
        </div>
        <div class="animal_question">Well, in fact, these arguments mirror the most commonly used arguments by speciesists and carnists, where the word "animals" has been substituted with the words "other races". By drawing parallels between racism and speciesism, the intention is to highlight the absurdity and ethical inconsistency of such reasoning, urging individuals to reassess their attitudes and behaviors towards non-human animals, because speciesism is not different from racism. If you agree that speciesism is ethically as wrong as racism and you want to stand against, you can click this buton <button id="animal_liberation">Animal Liberation</button>
