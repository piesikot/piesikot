# Dog and Cat — dogcat...what?

## _Emil Piesik_ that’s what!

My portfolio of web projects.

## Launch

- Just go to the live site: [piesikot.co](https://piesikot.co) :dog: :cat:.
- Or open the file [index.html](index.html) in your browser.

## About the site

The site was created in a minimalist style, where figuratively and literally everything\* is shown in black and white.

- In the bottom left corner there is my logo, created from a photo of my late dog, Perełka, to which all rights are reserved.

- In the top right corner there is a dropdown list with links to my projects. On small screens or with high resolution, the list can be scrolled.

Additionally, I added some decoration in the form of famous cats, because who doesn’t like cute and funny cats? Well, to be honest, I’m that kind of person, since cats are predatory, bloodthirsty, malicious, cynical, deceitful, and have no feelings. But hey, at least they don’t help the police search for drugs, and my surname in polish language is dog and cat, without the last two letters — Piesik and cat that’s what.

Moreover, none of the cats on the site are my property, because it’s the human who belongs to the cat, not the other way around... The copyright holders are other people listed in the appropriate places, and I use images only to demonstrate my ability to implement them on the site.

The site contains interactive elements, for example, a text-based cat hiding in the bottom right corner of the page. To make the cat reveal itself, just pet it with the cursor or your finger (on touchscreens). In addition, some of the cats can be interacted with using buttons.

\*except for vegan Easter eggs ;)

## Projects

### 1. Todo List

#### About the project

My first, very simple web project. The application allows the user to add and remove tasks in a clean and straightforward list. The project is minimalistic, responsive, and available online in a live version at [this address](https://piesikot.co/todolist.html).

#### Technologies

- HTML5 – page structure.
- CSS3 – simple styling, responsive units (`vw`, `vmax`).
- Vanilla JavaScript – event handling (`addEventListener`), DOM manipulation (`createElement`, `appendChild`, `remove`).
- Responsiveness – thanks to relative units, the page adjusts to various screen resolutions.

### 2. racism.wtf

#### About the Project

A very simple project, kept in a minimalist style, yet functional, carrying an important message that gives food for thought to all opponents of racism.

#### Deployment

The site is available live at: [https://racism.wtf](https://racism.wtf)

#### Technologies

- HTML5 – the structure of the page.
- CSS3 – simple styles that emphasize the seriousness of the topic, without unnecessary decorations, so as not to distract from the message.
- Vanilla JavaScript – a simple script handling the button that, when clicked, reveals additional content on the page.
- Domain – chosen so that it itself becomes part of the message.

### 3. Piesik od Pokoleń (Piesik Through Generations)

#### **The site is in beta. Many things may not work correctly!**

A website project presenting the activities of a local farm engaged in raising animals for meat and dairy production.

Because this is a website for a Polish farm, it is available only in Polish. However, we warmly invite you to see the [offer from our international partners](https://piesikodpokolen.pl/partners.html).

#### 🌱 About the farm

- A farm run by a Polish farmer who loves his animals and ensures a high level of welfare.
- The farm is not an industrialized farm, animals are kept in good conditions and are slaughtered humanely.
- The meat meets all applicable quality and sanitary standards in accordance with European Union regulations.
